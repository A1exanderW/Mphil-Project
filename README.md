Author: Alexander Wang

This is a sub-project from within Mphil Project

# [ Amplicon sequencing heatmaps]
Uses results provided by UQ's ACE facility for 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, to process the taxonomy to the deepest level, then creates heatmaps to allow for visual comparison between different samples.
